    <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat",[10] is the founder and captain of
        the
        increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters.[26][27]
        He
        desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate
        King,[28]
        which would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers, and
        crew.[29][30]
        He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.[31]</p>
